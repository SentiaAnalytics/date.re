(** A {i mutable} sorted set module which allows customize {i compare} behavior.

   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
   and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map.

   All data are parameterized by not its only type but also a unique identity in
   the time of initialization, so that two {i Sets of ints} initialized with different
   {i compare} functions will have different type.

   For example:
   {[
     type t = int * int 
      module I0 =
        (val Belt.Id.comparableU ~cmp:(fun[\@bs] ((a0,a1) : t) ((b0,b1) : t) ->
             match Pervasives.compare a0 b0 with
             | 0 -> Pervasives.compare a1 b1
             | c -> c 
           ))
    let s0 = make ~id:(module I0)
    module I1 =
      (val Belt.Id.comparableU ~cmp:(fun[\@bs] ((a0,a1) : t) ((b0,b1) : t) ->
           match compare a1 b1 with
           | 0 -> compare a0 b0
           | c -> c 
         ))
    let s1 = make ~id:(module I1)
   ]}


   Here the compiler would infer [s0] and [s1] having different type so that
    it would not mix.

   {[
     val s0 : ((int * int), I0.identity) t 
     val s1 : ((int * int), I1.identity) t 
   ]}

   We can add elements to the collection:

   {[

     let () =
       add s1 (0,0);
       add s1 (1,1)
   ]}

   Since this is an mutable data strucure, [s1] will contain two pairs.
